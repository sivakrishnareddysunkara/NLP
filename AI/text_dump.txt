 code to initialize the ethernet ports so that the do not have to wait on the handshaking which was 
 
 delaying the initialization process 
 
 
 
 Fixed several Jiras to enhance the operation of the system One added enhancement was for mail 
 
 pieces to look ahead where when a mail piece is destined for a pocket a mail piece that is imme 
 
 diately following the mail piece to the same pocket will keep that gate open for the following and 
 
 the following mail piece The prevented the gate to inadvertently timeout and close on a mail piece

 were seeing echo commands from a Sort code Verifier when the system was not expecting it The 
 
 message we were sending had the same sequence number as the command coming back thus 
 
 creating the anomaly 
 
 
 
 Responsible for the coding and integration of the DIOSS B machine Had to make sure the hard 
 
 ware mapping was correct During integration had to bring the FW up and running and make sure

I had the pleasure of having Jeremy serve in my organization client services for over a decade During that time Jeremy earned several promotions 
and ultimately ascended to a supervision role and a key member of the leadership team His competency level is above average and he was a high level 
performer throughout his time in product support system support and project management 
 
Jeremy always possessed a desire to learn and develop his skill sets There were countless times where we would launch new initiatives and it would be 
Jeremy who stepped up to learn and master new tools to ensure success On occasion we would bring to him an idea of a deliverable and he would run 
with it and produce a viable design even when there was limited or no budgetary funds His knowledge of systems and tools became well known across 
our company so much so he was regularly engaged by our product I T and communications teams for projects they were leading Although Jeremy 
did not possess a formal education in some of these areas his aptitude and abilities rivaled anyone within the organization who possessed 
Indeed Jeremy has a high level technical skill set but he also understands customers He knows the importance of developing relationships and 
evaluating how our initiatives process changes might affect customers His work with high profile clients on integrations and project work routinely 
produced positive feedback for his efforts 
 
Jeremy has my respect and that of management He showed a great deal of self sacrifice to learn skills that would allow him to compete for 
opportunities across several areas of expertise We considered him one of the main reasons for our success 
Jeremy has developed into a strategic thinker and can manage long term projects and initiatives He does not shy away from accountability and runs to 
any challenge he sees before him

Ms 
 
Let me start by saying that James saved the day for my organization 
Our organization is currently in a re branding phase and we need to change everything with our old name attached to it with our new name I was told late last week to ensure our website is up and running with the new logos by
15 Mar I placed the ticket on Thursday or Friday of last week and by
today the change I needed to happen on the backend was not only completed but explained to me in detail on how the process is suppose to occur I
asked James to explain because this was the first time I have to do something like this so I wanted to make sure I understood the process for future issues As a result of James professionalism and knowledge I will be able to give my boss LTC good news about our website I really
appreciate the quick turnaround and I have requested James to assist me with another issue I can only imagine your team being one of the best if you have people like James on it I just wanted to let his supervisor know that he deserves KUDOS for saving the day 
 
Thank you for your time

This short letter is an explanation of my resume timeline Towards the end of 2014 while working at United States Steel a trade violation occurred involving illegal steel pipe being sold to our country This violation resulted in the termination of everyone at the facility I was employed This trade act violation created what is known as being laid off due to no fault of your own and involves special benefits from the government including the ability to be retrained in a relevant field of your choosing At this point I decided to go back and get my Masters of Business at Gannon University in Erie Pennsylvania I also began looking for work in Erie 
At the same time my mother who lived in Syracuse New York had her mesothelioma lung cancer come out of remission While attending my Master s classes I spent most of my free time traveling home to assist in the care of my mother Therefore I was not able to obtain a job As I completed my final semester at Gannon University I decided it would be best to move back to New York By this time my mother had passed and my father was quite devastated I thought it would be best to spend some time supporting my father and helping around the house Now that things are better I m not only able but excited to get back to work I hope that the lapse in work experience doesn t take away from what I accomplished in my career at US Steel

CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR SAUDI OGER LTD 
 
 
MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES
 
OF
 
CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR
 
For suppliers 
 
We execute the contract entered into by the company the tendering department and the awarded bidder and the supplier by opening a LETTER OF CREDIT to the bank here and abroad with a definite amount and maturity date in which our company has an account 
 
It is also stated in the L C that materials supplies may be delivered partially in shipments 
 
Then we pay the supplier by ordering the bank upon presentation of the waybill or bill of lading of the materials together with the packing list The bank then releases the payment consequently upon the maturity of the L C We pay suppliers 100 thru L C by ordering the bank to release the completion to full amount of the L C upon maturity 
 
 
 
For Sub contractors 
 
We received progress report for our Quality control engineers at site and our contract administrator on site about the percentage of completion of the work Then we prepare payment in proportion to the percentage of completion pro rata to the whole amount of the base contract When we prepare the payment request we forward it to the QUALITY CONTROL depart head for approval before we release our order to the bank to effect the payment to the bank account of the sub contractor 
 
 
 
ASIDE FROM SUPLIER AND SBUCONTRACTORS WE ARE ALSO IN CHARGHE OF THE TRANSPORTION EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY IN RELATION TO THE SUPPLIES OF MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY
 
Basically this is AUDITING ACCOUNTING in scope The scope of work is about transportation charges by our TRANSPORT COMMISSIONERS either by sea air land Materials that are use in construction come from France which are being shipped by our TRANSPORT COMMISSIONER Under normal conditions freight charges including customs duties are to be shouldered by Saudi Oger but there are some cases cost of transportation to the KINGDOM and customs duties are to be paid by the supplier then we prepare DEBIT NOTES which will be deducted from the claims of the sub contractor from Saudi Oger and to be forwarded to our QUANTITY SURVEYORS to put into effect of the debits Quantity Surveyors prepare the payment to Sub contractors based on the work completed which are certified by SITE QUANTITY SURVEYORS 
 
TRANSPORTATION CHARGES are paid base on contract These may be import or export of materials from to any countries in Europe USA Morocco or any other countries Transportations made OUT THE CONTRACT are treated exceptions we ask the transportation department to prepare the OUT OF CONTRACT FORMS and process them to be signed by the Transportation Manager and the Division Manager When verifying transportation invoice we take into account the weight or volume of the materials the size of the containers used By land we take into account the distance traveled base on contract penalties of delay are deducted 
 
Before we prepare payment the following must be provided detailed packing list certificate of origin airway bill for airfreight bill of lading for sea freight site delivery receipt 
 
During transportation in transit damaged of materials being shipped may occur if this happens the site transport office prepares the DECLARATION OF DAMAGED MATERIALS which will be certified by the SITE QUANTITY SURVEYORS upon receipt of the said declaration we forward the claims documents which include packing list of the shipment picture of the damaged or declaration of missing items to the transport commissioner which in turn the commissioner will forward the claims to the insurance agency The insurance agency will assess the real amount of the claims and eventually will release the reimbursement to the transport commissioner The Transport commissioner claims insurance claims for damaged materials in transit from insurer The transport commissioner will then in turn issue us a CREDIT NOTE for the value of the damaged or missing materials in transit Credit Note will then be deducted to the settlement we pay to our TRANSPORT COMMISIONER 
 
CUSTOMS CHARGES are being paid by the commissioner in advance which are reimbursed by Saudi Oger 
Customs invoices are reviewed if the amount of customs paid is correct and if the necessary documents are attached if correct we then enter them in our oracle data base and them we will forward the invoice to the internal control 
 
Our construction projects are all over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia so we have TRANSPORTATION INTER SITES which are done by our transportation commissioner We consider the distance traveled and the duration of the travel if it conforms to the contract We impose penalties for delays in delivery which were stipulated in the contract We see to it that their invoices to us are in accordance with the contract We certify the correctness of the invoices and forward them to Finance Department for payment Rejected invoices are returned to transport commissioners for rectification 
 
The prepared PAYMENT CERTIFICATE with the BANK TRANSFER to TRANSPORT COMMISSIONER will be signed by my immediate supervisor our department head and eventually by the Finance Manager and THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR FINANCE before it will be paid by the bank via BANK TRANSFER to the account of our transport commissioner
